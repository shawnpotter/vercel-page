					<h2 className='py-4'>About Me</h2>
					<p className='py-2'>
						In June of 2022, I graduated with my Bachelor's in Software
						Development. An avid gamer, I've was always interested in technology
						and how it works. When I started learning to code in High School I
						knew it was something I wanted to pursue.
					</p>
					<p className='py-2'>
						Getting deeper into software development I realized that I had found
						a niche in life, something that I can not just do, but be actively
						good at. Since graduating I've spent my time expanding my tech stack
						and working on projects. My focus has mostly been on front-end and
						full-stack development with an emphasis on React.js. However, I've
						also taken the time to learn other popular frameworks.
					</p>
					<p className='py-2'>
						Currently I work as a contract software developer working with
						Artificial Intelligence, where I work with AI models to perfect them
						into useful tools for developers like me.
