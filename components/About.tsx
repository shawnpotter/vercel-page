					<h2 className='py-4'>About Me</h2>
					<p className='py-2'>
						In June of 2022, I graduated with my Bachelor's in Software
						Development. It's been a long road getting to this point and hasn't
						always been an easy one. Adversity, nor a pandemic, could stop me
						from finally achieving my goals.
					</p>
					<p className='py-2'>
						Getting deeper into software development I realized that I had found
						a niche, something that I can not just do, but be actively good at.
						Since graduating I've spent my time expanding my tech stack and
						working on projects. My focus has mostly been on front-end and
						full-stack development with an emphasis on React.js. However, I've
						also taken the time to learn other popular frameworks.
